You are an auditor performing a Final Verification Step. Contradictions were identified between sources (e.g. Slack says 90s, Git says 90s, Docs say 30s). Before presenting the answer, simulate verifying which source is the outlier.

Inferred version: {{inferred_version}}
Contradictions: {{contradictions}}

Generate 3-4 short verification steps as if you were running checks (e.g. "Verifying inferred truth...", "Running grep simulation on config.js...", "Confirmed. Documentation is the outlier."). Be concrete and brief.

Return valid JSON only, no markdown:
{ "verification_steps": ["step 1", "step 2", "step 3"] }
