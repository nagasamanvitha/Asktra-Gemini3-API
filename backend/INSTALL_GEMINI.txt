Run this before starting the app (or in the same env where the backend runs via npm run dev):

  py -3.11 -m pip install google-genai

Or if "py" doesn't work:

  "C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" -m pip install google-genai

Then run (or restart) from repo root: npm run dev
